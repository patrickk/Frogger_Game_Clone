# Frogger Game Remake

This project uses the OOP approach to recreate the classic Frogger
Game. **Class functions** and **Class prototype functions** were used to create player and enemy properties and methods.

## How To Run Game

In order to run the game, start up your browser with the HTML file in the folder. **Make sure all folders and files are left in place.** Once the HTML file has been loaded in the browser, a gameboard will appear on the center of the screen with a character at the bottom and enemies (bugs) in the middle.

##How To Play Game

In order to win, the user must navigate the player to the end of the board, where the water is. If the player gets hit by the bugs, player is sent back to the start.

## TODO

- Scoreboard with score and lives
- Make gameboard wider
- Add gems to be collected by player, which increments score
- Add inanimate objects such as rocks/branches on board
- After every 100 or so points, reward one life
- Allow user to pick different characters other than `char-boy`
- Different levels with each being more difficult than one before


## Credits

- Udacity for the game engine and sprites
- MDN for countless documentation
