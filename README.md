# Frogger Game Remake

This project uses the OOP approach to recreate the classic Frogger
Game. **Class functions** and **Class prototype functions** were used to create player and enemy properties and methods.

## How To Run Game

In order to run the game, start up your browser with the HTML file in the folder. **Make sure all folders and files are left in place.** Once the HTML file has been loaded in the browser, a gameboard will appear on the center of the screen with a character at the bottom and enemies (bugs) in the middle.

## How-To-Play

- Use arrow keys to navigate the player
- Get to the end of the map (water) to win 100 points
- Don't get hit by the bugs or else you'll lose a life!
- Lose all lives, lose your points

## Credits

- Udacity for the game engine and sprites
- MDN for countless documentation

## TODO

- Make gameboard wider
- Add gems to be collected by player, which increments score
- Add inanimate objects such as rocks/branches on board
- After every 500 or so points, reward one life
- Allow user to pick different characters other than `char-boy`
- Different levels with each being more difficult than one before
- Change design
